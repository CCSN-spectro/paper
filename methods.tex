\section{Methods description}
\label{methods}

In this section, we outline a strategy for estimating the time evolution of the
ratio $r=M_{\rm PNS}/R_{\rm PNS}^2$ of the mass of the PNS and its squared radius
(in units of solar mass and km) from the observation of the $\mbox{}^2g_2$
oscillation mode in the gravitational wave detector data.
An integral part of this strategy is the universal relations that relate the
characteristic frequency of the PNS oscillation $f$, $g$ and $p$ modes with the mass
and the radius of the PNS, the shock radius and the total mass inside the shock as
demonstrated in \cite{Torres:2019b}.

\pcd{To build the model of the ratio $r$ as a function of the frequency $f$ we use the 
spherically symetric (1D) simulations of the {\it model set}. Figure~\ref{fig:LMVAR}
shows the data for the $25$ numerical simulations. As identified by \cite{Torres:2019b}, the only systematic
deviation from a single universal relation is the numerical code used in the simulations. 
To avoid any systematic effect, we only use the $18$ simulations performed with the ALCAR-AENUS
code, which is the same code that was used in our test set. The consequences of this choice are discussed in the
conclusions. Using this data, we} parametrize the ratio with a cubic polynomial
regression with heteroscedastic errors
%Here we are using the data from \textcolor{red}{only {\sc AENUS-ALCAR} or both?, maybe colour-code the two groups of data points } to fit a cubic polyn

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:model1}
r_i=\beta_1 f_i + \beta_2 f_i^2 +\beta_3 f_i^3 + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be independent zero-mean Gaussian errors with
variances $\sigma_i^2$ that increase with frequency $f_i$. The model for frequency-dependent
variances is
\begin{equation}
\log \sigma_i=\alpha_0+ \alpha_1 f_i + \alpha_2 f_i^2 + \delta_i
\end{equation}
with independent and identically zero-mean Gaussian errors $\delta_i$. The R-package \texttt{lmvar}
\cite{lmvar:2019} that implements a maximum likelihood approach was used to fit the model.

The best fitting model amongst polynomials of degree 1, 2, and 3  was chosen according to
the Aikaike information criterion with coefficients given in Table \ref{tab:model}, which is actually the model defined in \eqref{eq:model1}.  The data and fit of the model including 95\% confidence bands are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:LMVAR}.

%\begin{equation}\label{eq:universal}
%r_i = \beta_1 f_i + \beta_3 f_i^3 + \epsilon_i
%\end{equation}

%The best-fitting model achieves a coefficient of determination of $R^2=0.9812$.
%The data and fit of the model including 95\% confidence bands are displayed in

\pcd{We use this model to infer the properties of the simulations in the 
{\it test set} described in in Section \ref{sec:simulations}.}
To describe the method we focus on the gravitational wave signal
of {\texttt s20S}, originally
sampled at 16384 Hz but resampled at 4096 Hz.
A spectrogram of this signal is shown in Figure \ref{fig:spectrogram} based on
autoregressive estimates \pcd{[CITATION?]}of the local spectra for successive time intervals of 
\textcolor{red}{length 200} with a \textcolor{red}{ 90\%} overlap.
The dominant emission mode corresponds to the PNS oscillation $\mbox{}^2 g_2$-mode. We have
developed a time-frequency method to track the ridge $m(t)$ in the spectrogram,
taking into account that it is monotonically increasing as time goes. 
\pcd{This is a property of the $\mbox{}^2 g_2$-mode, the frequency of which  
increases as the object becomes more massive and compact}.
Starting from either the left- or right-most column of the time-frequency matrix
we identify and trace the sequence of amplitude peaks within a certain frequency
band given the monotonicity constraint. Appendix \ref{app:gmode} is providing more
details on the reconstruction of the $g$ mode ridge. 


\begin{figure}

 \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{plots/spectrogram}
 \caption{Spectrogram of the gravitational wave signal {\texttt s20S} sampled at \unit[4096]{Hz}.
   The spectrogram is obtained using data streach of 200 samples overlapping at 90\%
   with each other.} \label{fig:spectrogram}
\end{figure}


We collect the instantaneous frequency $f(t_i)$ corresponding to the ridge $m(t_i)$ for
the midpoint $t_i$ of each local time interval of the spectrogram and interpolating $f(t)$
for values in between the $t_i$. We then use \pcd{our model given by Eq.~}
\eqref{eq:model1} to obtain
estimates of the time evolution of the ratio together with 95\% confidence intervals.
An exemple is given in Figure \ref{fig:ratio} where the red points are the point estimates and
the grey bands represent 95\% confidence bands. Ratio values
computed using the mass and radius values obtained from the simulation code \pcd{(true values)} are shown in black.

 \caption{Ratio $M_{\rm PNS}/R_{\rm PNS}^2$ as function of time extracted from the $\mbox{}^2 g_2$-mode of the {\texttt s20S} signal (red points and the 95\% confidence belt in grey) compared to the ratio value derived from the PNS mass and radius given by the simulation code (black points) \mab{To be redone in python}.} \label{fig:ratio}
\end{figure}


In this case, for a GW signal without any noise, the coverage of our 95\% confidence band is 94\% \pcd{of the true values}.
In the next section we investigate the performance of \pcd{the} reconstruction of $r(t)$ when the gravitational wave
signal is embedded in noise.
