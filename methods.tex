\section{Methods description}
In this section, we outline a strategy for estimating the time evolution of the ratio $r=M_{\rm PNS}/R_{\rm PNS}^2$ of the mass of the proto-neutron star (PNS) and its squared radius \textcolor{red}{(units, solar Mass and km?)} based on
the CCSN gravitational wave observations.
An integral part of this strategy is the universal relationship between the characteristic frequency and the ratio of mass and radius as demonstrated by  \cite{Torres:2019}
on 25 1D simulations with the
{\sc AENUS-ALCAR }code \cite{} and the {\sc CoCoNuT} \cite{} code. Here we are using the data from \textcolor{red}{only {\sc AENUS-ALCAR} or both?, maybe colour-code the two groups of data points } to fit a cubic polynomial regression with
heteroscedastic errors
\begin{equation}
r_i=\beta_1 f_i + \beta_2 f_i^2 +\beta_3 f_i^3 + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be independent zero-mean Gaussian errors with  variances $\sigma_i^2$ that increase with $f_i$. The model for frequency-dependent variances is
\begin{equation}
\log \sigma_i=\alpha_0+ \alpha_1 f_i + \alpha_2 f_i^2 + \delta_i
\end{equation}
with independent and identically zero-mean Gaussian errors $\delta_i$. The R-package LMVAR
{\textcolor{red}{add citation} that implements a maximum likelihood approach was used to fit the model. The
best fitting model amongst polynomials of degree 1, 2, and 3  was chosen according to the  AIC, i.e. \textcolor{red}{insert correct estimates}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:universal}
r_i=f_i + f_i^3 + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}
 The best-fitting model achieves a coefficient of determination of $R^2=$  \textcolor{red}{insert Rsquared}.
Parameter estimates and their standard errors are given in \textcolor{red}{ add Table xxx}.
The data and fit of the model including 95\% confidence bands are displayed in Figure \ref{Fig:LMVAR}.

Here we analyse the gravitational wave signal {\tt s20-gw-10kpc} \textcolor{red}{insert more detailed description}, originally sampled at 10 kHz but resampled to the LIGO sampling rate of 16384 Hz.
A spectrogram of this signal is shown in Figure \textcolor{red}{insert spectrogram of signal} based on autoregressive estimates of the local spectra for successive time intervals of 
\textcolor{red}{length 200} with a \textcolor{red}{ 90\%} overlap.The dominant emission mode correspondes to the $\mbox{ }^2 g_1$-mode \cite{} and we have developed a time-frequency method to track the ridge $m(t)$ in the spectrogram, taking into account that it is monotonically increasing. Starting from either the left- or right-most column of the time-frequency  matrix we identify and trace the sequence of amplitude peaks within a certain frequency band given the monotonicity constraint. \textcolor{red}{Are more details regarding the ridge tracking required here?}

We identify the instantaneous frequency $f(t_i)$ corresponding the  ridge $m(t_i)$ for the midpoint $t_i$ of each local time interval of the spectrogram and interpolating $f(t)$
for values in between the $t_i$. Now we can use the universal relationship in (\ref{eq:universal}) to obtain estimates of the time evolution of the
ratios together with 95\% confidence intervals. These are given in Figure \ref{fig:xx} \textcolor{red}{insert figure} where the black points are the true ratio values, the red points the
estimates and the grey bands represent 95\% confidence bands. In this case without any noise, the coverage of our 95\% confidence band is xx\%.

In the following simulation study we explore how accurately we can estimate the parameters when the gravitational wave signal is embedded in noise.
For that purpose, we inject the gravitational wave signal into  simulated Advanced LIGO noise using the noise power spectral density \textcolor{red}{insert formula} for varying
SNRs, respectively distances to the source. We estimate the coverage probability of the 95\% confidence band by calculating the proportion of times that the true ratio lies outside one of the pointwise 95\% confidence intervals.
These coverage probabilities together for varying SNRs are given in Table \textcolor{red}{insert Table} and displayed in the form of boxplots in Figure \textcolor{red}{insert Figure}
