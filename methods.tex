We next outline our strategy for estimating the time evolution of $r(t)$
%ratio $r=M_{\rm PNS}/R_{\rm PNS}^2$ (in units of solar mass and km) 
from the observation of the $\mbox{}^2g_2$ oscillation mode in the GW detector data.
%An integral part of this strategy is the universal relations that relate the
%characteristic frequency of the PNS oscillation $f$, $g$ and $p$ modes with the mass
%and the radius of the PNS, the shock radius and the total mass inside the shock as
%demonstrated in \cite{Torres:2019b}.
To build the model of the ratio $r$ as a function of the frequency $f$ we use the 
1D simulations of the {\it model set}. Figure~\ref{fig:LMVAR}
shows the data for the $18$ numerical simulations. 
%As identified by \cite{Torres:2019b}, the only systematic deviation from a single universal relation is the numerical code used in the simulations. 
%To avoid any systematic effect, we only use the $18$ simulations performed with the {\sc AENUS-ALCAR}
%code, which is the same code that was used in our test set.
%\mab{We defer a discussion of the possible consequences of this choice in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.}
%The consequences of this choice are discussed in the conclusions.
Using these data we parametrize the discretized ratio $r_i$ with a cubic polynomial
regression with heteroscedastic errors
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:model1}
r_i=\beta_1 f_i + \beta_2 f_i^2 +\beta_3 f_i^3 + \epsilon_i\,,
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be independent zero-mean Gaussian errors with
variances $\sigma_i^2$ that increase with frequency $f_i$. The model for frequency-dependent
variances is
\begin{equation}
\log \sigma_i=\alpha_0+ \alpha_1 f_i + \alpha_2 f_i^2 + \delta_i\,,
\end{equation}
with independent and identically zero-mean Gaussian errors $\delta_i$. The R-package \texttt{lmvar}~\citep{lmvar:2019} that implements a maximum likelihood approach was used to fit the model.

\textcolor{red}{For the mean of the ratios $r_i$, the cubic model has the best fitting amongst polynomials of lower degrees, and for the mean of the log standard deviation $\log\sigma_i$, the quadratic model has the best fit compared to a polynomial of degree one.  The models were compared according to the Akaike information criterion.  The estimated coefficients are given in Table \ref{tab:model} and the data and fit of the final model including 95\% confidence bands are displayed in
Figure~\ref{fig:LMVAR}.}

%The best fitting model amongst polynomials of degree 1, 2, and 3  was chosen according to the Akaike information criterion with coefficients given in Table \ref{tab:model}, which is actually the model defined in \eqref{eq:model1}.  The data and fit of the model including 95\% confidence bands are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:LMVAR}.

%\begin{equation}\label{eq:universal}
%r_i = \beta_1 f_i + \beta_3 f_i^3 + \epsilon_i
%\end{equation}

%The best-fitting model achieves a coefficient of determination of $R^2=0.9812$.
%The data and fit of the model including 95\% confidence bands are displayed in

{We use this model to infer the properties of the simulations in the 
{\it test set} discussed in Section \ref{sec:simulations}.}
To describe the method we focus on the GW signal
of model {\texttt s20S}, originally
sampled at \unit[16384]{Hz} but downsampled at \unit[4096]{Hz}.
A spectrogram of this signal is shown in Figure \ref{fig:spectrogram} based on
autoregressive estimates~\citep{BrockwellPeterJ1991Tsta} of the local spectra for successive time intervals of length 200 with a 90\% overlap.
The dominant emission mode corresponds to the PNS oscillation $\mbox{}^2 g_2$-mode. We have
developed a time-frequency method to track the ridge $m(t) $ in the spectrogram,
taking into account that it is monotonically increasing with time. 
This is a property of the $\mbox{}^2 g_2$-mode whose frequency   
increases as the PNS becomes more massive and compact.
Starting from either the left- or right-most column of the time-frequency matrix
we identify and trace the sequence of amplitude peaks within a certain frequency
band given the monotonicity constraint. Specific details about the reconstruction of the $\mbox{}^2 g_2$-mode ridge 
are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:gmode}. 

\begin{figure}

 \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{plots/spectrogram}
 \caption{Spectrogram of the GW signal {\texttt s20S} sampled at \unit[4096]{Hz}.
   The spectrogram is obtained using a data streach of 200 samples overlapping at 90\%
   with each other. The open circles track the ridge $m(t) $ of the $\mbox{}^2 g_2$-mode. } \label{fig:spectrogram}
\end{figure}

We collect the instantaneous frequency $f(t_i)$ corresponding to the ridge $m(t_i)$ for
the midpoint $t_i$ of each local time interval of the spectrogram and interpolate $f(t)$
for values in between $t_i$. We then use our model given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:model1} to obtain
estimates of the time evolution of the ratio together with 95\% confidence intervals.
An example is given in Figure \ref{fig:ratio} where the red triangles are the point estimates and
the grey bands represent 95\% confidence bands. The size of the red triangles is proportional to the magnitude of the $\mbox{}^2 g_2$-mode frequency estimates.
Note that as the frequency of the $\mbox{}^2 g_2$-mode becomes higher our estimates show more uncertainty (bigger intervals) because our model allows for heterogeneous variance. Ratio values
computed using the mass and radius values obtained from the simulation code (i.e.~the true values)
are shown in black. In this example of a noise-free GW signal the coverage of our 95\% confidence band is 100\%
of the true values. In the next section we investigate the performance of the reconstruction of $r(t)$ when the GW
signal is embedded in noise. We also note that despite we have only explicitely shown results for the GW signal of the {\texttt s20S} model the same conclusions hold for any of the other waveforms of our test set.

The size of the triangles are represented proportionally to the magnitude of the $\mbox{}^2 g_2$-mode frequency estimates.}
