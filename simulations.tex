{Unless other methods used GW astronomy, the} algorithm proposed in {this work} does not require accurate
waveforms {in order to infer the properties of the PNS.} {Instead, it relies on the evolution of the frequency of
oscillation of some particular modes, as seen in the GW spectrum. The frequency of these modes depends, in a universal way, 
on the surface gravity of the PNS ($r=M_{\rm PNS}/R_{\rm PNS}^2$), in the sense that if at a given time we observe GW emission
at a certain frequency $f$ we can determine univocally the value of the surface gravity, within a certain error, regardless of the details
of the numerical simulation. In this work we use two sets of simulations: i) The {\it model set}, composed by 1D simulations, which is used 
to build the universal relation (model), $r(f)$, linking the ratio $r$ with the observed frequency $f$, and ii) the {\it test set}, composed by 2D simulations, 
for which we know both the GW signal and the evolution of the ratio, $r (t)$, and that is used to test performance of the algorithm.}

{We have used two different numerical codes in our numerical simulations.} 
%CoCoNuT
%(one-dimensional models) and AENUS-ALCAR
%\citep{Just_et_al__2015__mnras__Anewmultidimensionalenergy-dependenttwo-momenttransportcodeforneutrino-hydrodynamics}
%(one- and two-dimensional models). 
CoCoNuT
\citep{Dimmelmeier:2002,Dimmelmeier:2005} is a code for general
relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to the Fast Multigroup Transport
scheme \citep{Mueller_Janka_2015_FMT} providing an approximate
description of the emission and transport of neutrinos. AENUS-ALCAR
\citep{Just_et_al__2015__mnras__Anewmultidimensionalenergy-dependenttwo-momenttransportcodeforneutrino-hydrodynamics}
combines special relativistic (magneto-)hydrodynamics, a modified
Newtonian gravitational potential approximating the effects of general
relativity \citep{Marek_etal__2006__AA__TOV-potential}, and a spectral
two-moment neutrino transport solver
\citep{Just_et_al__2015__mnras__Anewmultidimensionalenergy-dependenttwo-momenttransportcodeforneutrino-hydrodynamics}.
We included the relevant reactions between matter and neutrinos of all
flavours, i.e., emission and absorption by nucleons and nuclei,
electron-positron pair annihilation, nucleonic bremsstrahlung, and
scattering off nucleons, nuclei, and electrons.

{For the {\it model set}, we use the $25$ spherically symmetric (1D) simulations of \citep{Torres:2019a}
including progenitors with zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses in the range 
$M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}} = 11.2 - 75 \, \Msol$. The set contains simulations using the
 two numerical codes and six different equations of state. Details can be found in
 \citep{Torres:2019a}. The reason to use one dimensional simulations for the model set
 is that the computational cost of those is significantly smaller than the cost of multidimensional
 simulations, so is easier to accumulate the statistics necessary to build a good model for $r(f)$.}
 \pcd{For each time of each simulation we compute the ratio $r$ and the frequency of the $^2g_2$ mode by means of the linear analysis
 described in \cite{Torres:2018,Torres:2019a,Torres:2019b}. }

{For the {\it test set}, we use $8$ axisymmetric (2D) simulations using the AENUS-ALCAR code
(see Table~\ref{Tab:2dSimList} for a list of models).
$7$ of these simulations use a selection of progenitors with masses in the range} $M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}} = 11.2 - 40 \, \Msol$
 evolved through the hydrostatic phases by
\cite{Woosley_Heger_Weaver__2002__ReviewsofModernPhysics__The_evolution_and_explosion_of_massive_stars}.
We performed one simulation of each stellar model using the equation
of state of \cite{Lattimer_Swesty__1991__NuclearPhysicsA__LS-EOS} with
an incompressibility of $K = 220 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ (LS220) and added
comparison simulations with the SFHo EOS
\cite{Steiner_et_al__2013__apj__Core-collapseSupernovaEquationsofStateBasedonNeutronStarObservations}
and the GShen EOS 
\cite{Shen_et_al__2011__prc__Newequationofstateforastrophysicalsimulations}
for the {progenitor} with $M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}} = 15 \, \Msol$. To this set of
simulations, we add the waveform of a two-dimensional model used in
\cite{Torres:2019a}, denoted \texttt{s20S}. It corresponds to a star
with the same initial mass, $M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}} = 20 \, \Msol$, as for
one of the other 7 axisymmetric simulations, but was taken from a
newer set of stellar-evolution models
\cite{Woosley_Heger__2007__physrep__Nucleosynthesisandremnantsinmassivestarsofsolarmetallicity}.
It was evolved with the SFHo EOS.


{For all the simulations,} we mapped the pre-collapse state of the stars to a spherical
coordinate system with $n_r = 400$ zones in radial direction
distributed logarithmically with a minimum grid width of
$(\Delta r)_{\mathrm{min}} = 400 \, \mathrm{m}$ and an outer radius of
$r_{\mathrm{max}} = 8.3 \times 10^{9} \, \mathrm{cm}$ and
$n_{\theta} = 128$ equidistant cells in angular direction. For the
neutrino energies, we used a logarithmic grid with $n_e = 10$ bins up
to $240 \, \mathrm{MeV}$.
\pcd{Unlike the model set, the simulations in the test set are not 1D because we need to 
extract the gravitational wave signal, which is a multi-dimensional effect. For each simulation
we extract the gravitational wave signal, $h_+(t)$,  by means of the quadrupole formula and compute the 
time evolution of the surface gravity, $r(t)$.}

All spherical and most axisymmetric models fail to achieve shock
revival during the time of our simulations. Only the two stars with
the highest masses, \texttt{s25} and \texttt{s40}, develop relatively
late explosions in axisymmetry. Consequently, mass accretion onto the
PNSs proceeds at high rates for a long time in all cases and causes
them to oscillate with their characteristic frequencies. The final
masses of the PNSs are in the range of
$M_{\mathrm{PNS}} = 1.47 - 2.33 \, \Msol$, i.e., insufficient for
producing a black hole.
