Cosmic Explorer design sensitivity will be achieved in two stages. Stage 1 (CE1) is expected to use the technology developed for the ``A+'' upgrade to aLIGO but scaled up to a 40 km detector while stage 2 (CE2) will implement state-of-the-art technology to decrease quantum and thermal noises~\cite{reitze2019cosmic}.}

To estimate how accurately we can infer the time evolution of $r(t)$ in the GW data of a single
detector we inject the GW signal for model {\texttt s20S} into 
100 Gaussian noise realisations whose power spectral density (PSD) follows the aLIGO
spectrum~\cite{aLIGOsens:2018}. %The PSD of aLIGO and AdV at design sensitivities, along with those of planned third-generation detectors, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:spectrum}. 

We cover a large range of distances for which a CCSN detection in second-generation GW detectors is feasible. We assume that the source is optimally oriented with respect to our single detector. Moreover, we also assume that a CCSN GW signal has been identified in the data and that the beginning of the signal is known within {$\mathcal O$}(10 ms). The data (signal embedded in noise) are whitened using the function {\tt prewhiten} of the R-package {\tt TSA}. An auto-regressive model with a maximum of maximal 100 coefficients is used.    

For each of the noise realizations we reconstruct the ratio time series {$r_i$} of length $N$ starting from the left side of the spectrogram and constraining the beginning of the track to be smaller than \unit[200]{Hz}. \mab{This value is chosen using the information on the initial mode frequency from the simulations.}
The reconstructed ratio is then compared to the ``true'' ratio {$r_i^0$} derived from the PNS mass and radius computed from the {\texttt s20S} simulation. The top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:s20results} shows the distribution of the fraction of the ratio values {$r_i^0$} that fall within the 95\% confidence interval of {$r_i$} as a function of the distance to the source. This quantity, hence, gives information about the {\it coverage} of the reconstructed ratio. The coverage takes maximum values when the source is located within a few kpc and then decreases with the distance.

To better quantify how well we reconstruct the ratio we also consider  the mean of the relative error of $r_i$ along 
the track of the spectrogram, $\Delta$,  
\begin{equation}
\Delta=\frac{1}{N}\sum_1^N\frac{|r_i-r_i^0|}{r_i^0}\,.
\end{equation}
The values of $\Delta$ for each of the 100 noise realizations are shown as a function of the distance
in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:s20results}. For a source located up to $\sim$\unit[9]{kpc} the relative error
remains smaller than 20\%. At closer distances $\Delta$ is smaller but it does not vanish. This reflects the approximate nature of the model used for $r$. It is nevertheless remarkable that, on average, one can reconstruct the ratio time series with a good
precision up to distances of $\sim$ 9 kpc (for this particular waveform) with a coverage value
larger than 80\%. We note that there are a few noise realizations for distances below 9 kpc for which
$\Delta$ takes large values, indicating that the method fails to accurately reconstruct the ratio in those cases. \mab{The main cause of failure is the split of the ridge in few blobs when the signal becomes weaker and weaker.}
%\tf{Do we know why that is the case? What is intrinsically different from one noise realisation to another that makes the method more prone to failure? I think we should provide some explanation here, if we have it.}

\label{fig:aLIGO_prec_allwvf}
\end{figure}

We have tested that the method does not depend on the specific features of the waveform of model {\texttt s20S} by repeating the procedure for the remaining seven waveforms of the {\it test set} described in Section \ref{sec:simulations} covering
a large range of progenitor masses. Figure \ref{fig:aLIGO_cov_allwvf} shows that apart from model {\texttt s11} and to a lesser extent model {\texttt s20S}, the ratio is well reconstructed for all waveforms up to a distance of $\sim$ 15kpc. In an
effort to better determine the maximal distance of the source at which we can reconstruct the ratio we have run 100 simulations without injecting a signal and have measured the corresponding coverage for the reconstructed ratios.
\mab{The median of the coverage as well as the band defined by the $\mathrm{5^{th}}$ and $\mathrm{95^{th}}$ percentiles are shown in Figure \ref{fig:aLIGO_cov_allwvf}.}
The noise only median value is identically zero in this case. However, note that it could be different
from zero because
the g-mode reconstruction algorithm is looking for a continuously  increasing frequency track
in the spectrogram, starting between 0 and 200 Hz, where we expect the GW signal to be.
This is enhancing the probability of overlap. This effect explains why certain values of overlap can reach
values as high as 80\% even when no signal is added to the noise. \tf{I don't understand this last comment.} \mab{Toni: is that clearer?}

Figure \ref{fig:aLIGO_prec_allwvf} shows the relative error $\Delta$ as a function of the distance for the signals of the {\it test set}
as well as the result when only noise is considered. This quantity follows the same trend than that followed by the coverage, since all signals but models {\texttt s11} and {\texttt s20S} are reconstructed with relative errors below 20\% up to distances of $\sim$ 15kpc. Correspondingly, the no-signal case yields the largest error, as expected.

We perform the same analysis using the design sensitivity curve of AdV and expected sensitivity curves for third-generation 
GW detectors. The results for the former are reported in Table \ref{tab:results} and are discussed below. We focus now on third-generation detectors, presenting our findings in Table \ref{tab:results} and in Fig.~\ref{fig:s20--SFHo_all3G}. In Europe the Einstein Telescope project proposes to host in a 10-km equilateral triangle configuration three low-power, low-frequency, cryogenic interferometers as well as three high-power, high-frequency interferometers. Three sensitivity curves, ET-B, ET-C and ET-D corresponding to different options and stages of the project~\cite{Hild_2011} are considered in our study. %(cf.~Fig.~\ref{fig:spectrum}).
The US based project Cosmic Explorer~\cite{reitze2019cosmic} is expecting to reach its design
sensitivity circa 2040 through two phases labeled CE1 and CE2. %Their corresponding sensitivity curves are also shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spectrum}.

  \label{fig:s20--SFHo_all3G}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:s20--SFHo_all3G} displays $\Delta$ as a function of the source distance for the five third-generation detector configurations we analyze. As before, we use the {\texttt s20S} waveform model as a reference case.  This figure shows that,  overall, the ratio is well reconstructed up to distances in the range \unit[100--200]{kpc} which represents an order of magnitude improvement with respect to aLIGO and AdV. We also note that the results for the various Einstein Telescope configurations lay in between those of the two Cosmic Explorer designs. Moreover,  the detectability prospects for the former depend weakly on the detector configuration while the arrangement of CE2 yields better results than CE1. These results are confirmed for all other waveforms of our sample except for model {\texttt s25} for which the maximal distance reach in CE2 is significantly lower than CE1, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:distances}. This is partly due to the small variation of the reconstruction quality to the distance of the source making the estimation of $d_r$ rather uncertain for this particular waveform. \tf{Is this really understood? What's particular in this waveform?}

Some waveform maximal distance markers are not visible because the do overlap (for instance \texttt{s15G} is overlapping with \texttt{s25} for CE2).}

All results for both second-generation and third-generation detectors are summarized in Table \ref{tab:results} and Figure
\ref{fig:distances}. Table \ref{tab:results} reports the source distances $d_r$ in kpc at which the median of the coverage is lower than 95\% of the noise only values for aLIGO, AdV, and different configurations of third-generation detectors. This same information is displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:distances}. We have checked that using either the median of the coverage or the median of $\Delta$ yields similar results for the distance. On the other hand, the quality of the ratio reconstruction and, thus, of the distance range, depends on the signal-to-noise ratio, expressed in Table \ref{tab:results} by $d_{\rm det}$. The numbers reported on the table for $d_r$ are an estimate of the order of magnitude of the maximal distance of the source  at which a
reconstruction of the ratio could be possible with current and planned GW detectors. We also provide upper limits for $d_{\rm det}$ by taking into account the detector antenna response in our simulations and assuming that the source is optimally oriented with a matched filter signal-to-noise ratio of 13. Table \ref{tab:results} shows that the results for the Advanced Virgo detector at design sensitivity are very similar to those of aLIGO, despite the differences in detector sensitivity. It is remarkable that for third-generation detectors the PNS surface gravity  could be reconstructed for sources located up to a few hundreds of kpc. It is nevertheless important to note the rather wide range in distances we obtain for the different waveforms of our {\it test set} that probe a large range of progenitor masses. We do not find any correlation between either the mass of the progenitor nor the EOS with $d_r$.
