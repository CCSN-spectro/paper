\section{Detection sensitivity with Advanced gravitational wave detectors}
\label{sec:results}

To estimate how accurately we can infer the time evolution of $r=M_{\rm PNS}/R_{\rm PNS}^2$ in the
gravitational wave detector data, we have added \pcd{the} GW signal \pcd{from {\texttt s20S}} to 
100 Gaussian noise realisations whose power spectral density follows \pcd{the} advanced LIGO (aLIGO)
spectrum~\cite{aLIGOsens:2018} shown on Figure~\ref{fig:spectrum}. 
We have varied the distance to the source, covering a large
range of distances for which a detection in second generation of gravitational wave detectors
is feasible. The source is optimally oriented with
respect to the gravitational wave detector. We are assuming a GW signal from a core collapse
phenomena has been identified in the data and that the beginning of the GW signal is known within $O(10~ms)$.
The data (signal embedded in noise) are whitened using the function {\it prewhiten} of the R-package TSA.
An auto-regressive model with maximal \textcolor{red}{100} coefficients has been used.    

For each of the noise realisations, we reconstruct the ratio time series {$r_i$}
of length $N$ starting from the left side of the spectrogram and constraining the beginning of the
track to be smaller than \unit[200]{Hz}. The reconstructed ratio is then compare to the ``true'' ratio
{$r_i^0$} derived from the PNS mass and radius computed from the {\texttt s20S} simulation.

Figure \ref{fig:s20results} is showing the distribution of the fraction of the ratio {$r_i^0$} values that fall
within the 95\% confidence interval of {$r_i$}. This quantity, $coverage$, is taking maximal values
when the source is located within few kpc and then decreases with the distance.

To better quantify how well we reconstruct the ratio, we have also considered $\Delta$ the mean
over the track of the relative error of $r_i$. 

\begin{equation}
\Delta=\frac{1}{N}\sum_1^N\frac{|r_i-r_i^0|}{r_i^0}
\end{equation}

$\Delta$ values of each of the 100 noise realisation are shown as well as function of the distance
on Figure \ref{fig:s20results}. For a source located up to $\sim$\unit[10]{kpc} the relative error
remains smaller than 20\% \pcd{[PCD: should we comment on the outliers?]}. At small distance
$\Delta$ is small but not null. This reflects the approximation of the model used for $r$.
It is nevertheless remarkable that one can reconstruct the ratio time series with a good
precision at distance up to $\sim$ 9 kpc for this particular waveform, with $coverage$ value
larger than 80\%.
We have tested that the method does not depend on features of {\texttt s20S} using \pcd{the} 7
other waveforms \pcd{of the {\it test set}} described in section \ref{sec:simulations} covering
a large range of progenitor masses.
Figure \ref{fig:aLIGO_cov_allwvf} shows that apart {\tt s11.2--LS220}, the ratio is well
reconstructed for all waveforms up to $\sim$ 9kpc.
To measure the level of contamination of $coverage$ by reconstructed ratios not associated to a
signal, we have run 100 simulations without injecting a signal. The median of $coverage$ as well as
the 95 quartile are shown on Figure \ref{fig:aLIGO_cov_allwvf}. The noise only median value is
significantly different from zero because the g-mode reconstruction algorithm is looking for a
continuously frequency increasing track in the spectrogram, starting between 0 and 200 Hz.
Outliers can also reach values as high as 80\%.
Figure \ref{fig:aLIGO_prec_allwvf} shows $\Delta$ as function of the distance for the same signals
as well as the result when only noise is considered.
In Table \ref{tab:results} we are reporting the distance at which $coverage$ median is lower than
95\% of the noise only values. These numbers are an estimate of the order of magnitude of the 
source maximal distance at which a reconstruction of the ratio could be possible with current
and future generations of gravitational wave detectors. We have checked that $coverage$ and $\Delta$
provide similar values.

 \pcd{[PCD: I guess you use "coverage probability" because we are showing the box plots. Shouln't we say $\Delta$ probability as well? Or just "coverage"? Also, 
 how are outliers computed? Why are there so many outliers in $|delta$? If they are a significant fraction of the data points why are they considered outliers?]}}

The same analysis has been performed using expected sensitivity curves for the third generation of
gravitational wave detectors. The US based project Cosmic Explorer~\cite{reitze2019cosmic} is proposing
to reach out its design sensitivity circa 2040 through two phases labeled CE1 and CE2 also shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:spectrum}. In Europe, the Einstein Telescope is composed of three nested interferometers
in a configuration of an equilateral triange~\cite{Hild_2011}.
