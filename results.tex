\section{Detection sensitivity with Advanced gravitational wave detectors}
\label{sec:results}

To estimate how accurately we can infer the time evolution of $r=M_{\rm PNS}/R_{\rm PNS}^2$ in the
gravitational wave detector data, we have added {\texttt s20S} GW signal to 
100 Gaussian noise realisations whose power spectral density follows advanced LIGO (aLIGO)
spectrum~\cite{aLIGOsens:2018} shown on Figure~\ref{fig:spectrum}. 
We have varied the distance to the source, covering a large
range of distances for which a detection in second generation of gravitational wave detectors
is feasible. The source is optimally oriented with
respect to the gravitational wave detector. We are assuming a GW signal from a core collapse
phenomena has been identified in the data and that the beginning of the GW signal is known within $O(10~ms)$.
The data (signal embedded in noise) are whitened using the function {\it prewhiten} of the R-package TSA.
An auto-regressive model with maximal \textcolor{red}{100} coefficients has been used.    

For each of the noise realisations, we reconstruct the ratio time series {$r_i$}
of length $N$ starting from the left side of the spectrogram and constraining the beginning of the
track to be smaller than \unit[200]{Hz}. The reconstructed ratio is then compare to the ``true'' ratio
{$r_i^0$} derived from the PNS mass and radius generated by the simulation code that produced {\texttt s20S}.

Figure \ref{fig:s20results} is showing the fraction of the ratio {$r_i^0$} values that fall
within the 95\% confidence interval of {$r_i$}. This quantity, $coverage$, is taking maximal values
when the source is located within few kpc and then decreases with the distance.

To better quantify how well we reconstruct the ratio, we have also considered $\Delta$ the mean
over the track of the relative error of $r_i$. 

\begin{equation}
\Delta=\frac{1}{N}\sum_1^N\frac{|r_i-r_i^0|}{r_i^0}
\end{equation}

$\Delta$ values of each of the 100 noise realisation are shown as well as function of the distance
on Figure \ref{fig:s20results}. For a source located up to $\sim$\unit[10]{kpc} the relative error
remains smaller than 20\%. At small distance $\Delta$ is small but not null. This reflects the
approximation of the model used for $r$.
It is nevertheless remarkable that one can reconstruct the ratio time series with a good
precision at distance up to $\sim$ 10 kpc for this particular waveform, with $coverage$ value
larger than 80\%.
We have tested that the method does not depend on features of {\texttt s20S} using 7 other waveforms
described in section \ref{sec:simulations} covering a large range of progenitor masses.
Figure \ref{fig:aLIGO_cov_allwvf} shows that apart {\tt s11.2--LS220}, the ratio is well
reconstructed for all waveforms up to $\sim$ 10kpc. On this figure we also show the $coverage$
value in case of absence of signal. The median value is significantly different from 0 because
the g-mode reconstruction algorithm is looking for a continuously frequency increasing track
in the spectrogram, starting between 0 and 200 Hz. In Table \ref{tab:results} we are reporting the
distance at which $coverage$ median is lower than 80\%.
